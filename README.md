# MNIST tutorial

**MNIST is a dataset containing tiny gray-scale images, each showing a handwritten digit, that is, 0, 1, 2, …, 9. Your mission is to analyze such an image, and tell what digit is written there. The dataset looks like this:**

### Handwritten digit recognition, in general, is a realistic task. The MNIST dataset is also not particularly small: it contains 60,000 images in the training set and 10,000 in the test set. Each image has a resolution of 28x28, totaling 28²=784 features — a rather high dimensionality. So why is MNIST a “Hello World” example? One reason is that it is surprisingly easy to obtain decent accuracy, like 90%, even with a weak or poorly designed machine learning model. A practical setting, seemingly challenging task, high accuracy with little work — a perfect combination for beginners.
